This is a collection of my assignments submitted for the course CH107, 'Physical Chemistry' taught at IIT Bombay.\
The course instructors were Prof. Anindya Dutta and Prof. Amber Jain.\
Assignment 1\
Schroedinger's Equation and Free Particle\
This is the most detailed submission out of all, later a one page limit has been followed as requited by the course.

Assignment 2\
Rigid Rotor and Hydrogen Atom

Assignment 3\
Wavefunctions of hydrogen atom

Assignment 4\
Wavefunction for multi electronic atoms

Assignment 5\
Dihydrogen molecule and hybridisation

Some of the summaries are perhaps too short, lots of mathematical details and other interesting things were not written due to restrictions on length of the document.\
These were made for the purpose of quick revision and to sneakily avoid having to draft a creative poem for the submission.
